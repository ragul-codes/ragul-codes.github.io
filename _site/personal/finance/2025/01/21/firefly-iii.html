<h1 id="money-management">Money Management</h1>

<p>If you are like me, who is just started with your Career. Its crucial to understand the power of Money management. I am not claiming myself as a Financial advisor 😝. There are many advisors out there, they might be able to help you more than I could.</p>

<p>But, there are certain things, I have been taught about Money management</p>

<ul>
  <li>You couldn’t (Ponadhuku apro kanaku poduradhu waste)</li>
</ul>

<p>So with that being said, you should know where I am going with, Everyone should know where are they getting money from, where are they spending the most and the least, etc…</p>

<p>Basically one should know in and out of all their money endpoints and some necessary analysis out of it, to easily manage it.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>

<p>Starting off with my own Personal experience. If you are thinking of something which has lines and rows (nope not notebooks😞), you are right. I did start using excel initially. Obviously, it works great for most of the people around me, Unfortunately not for me 🫠</p>

<p>It was such a pain to collate the transactions and maintain that in a structured form in Excel. At the end of the day, I couldn’t easily find out where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out</code> of Money endpoints thereby defeating the whole point of maintaining it.</p>
